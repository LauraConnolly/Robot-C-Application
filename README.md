# Robot-C-Application
This code was developed with a Lego EV3 using Robot C computing language. The purpose of this project is to program the robot in a way that allows it to speed up and slow down according to the movement of an object or “criminal” while sounding a police siren and displaying a stop sign. The robot was programmed to complete these actions and turn according to the EV3 touch sensors. The robot will execute the steps  5 times until the criminal/ object is “caught”.
